behavior, the roles of practitioners within the criminal justice 
system, and the critical-thinking and ethical decision-making 
strategies necessary to meet the professional demands of the 
field of criminal justice. 

What You’ll Learn
Through your coursework, you will learn how to

•  Evaluate the roles and responsibilities of police, courts, and  

corrections within the American criminal justice system 

•  Utilize ethical reasoning, analytical skills, and professional 

knowledge to investigate the implications of criminal justice 
policies or procedures on diverse social groups

•  Evaluate a business problem or opportunity to determine 
the extent data science can provide a viable solution, and 
translate the business problem into a viable project to meet 
organizational strategic and operational needs

•  Incorporate data security, data privacy, and risk management 
best practices in the planning, development, and implementa-
tion of data science solutions

•  Build and deploy the machine learning process throughout its 
life cycle in full compliance with best practices for tool evalu-
ation, model selection, and model validation

•  Leverage big data analytics and AI technology to create solu-
tions for stream analytics, text processing, natural language 
understanding, AI, and cognitive applications

Major in History
Like other liberal arts majors, a major in history offers a solid

graduate study. 

One of the very first schools to offer a degree program in history

teaching history in an online environment. Plus, if you’re based 
in the Washington, D.C., area, you’ll have myriad opportunities to 
find internships and part-time and full-time jobs in the field via 
public institutions and federal positions. Our alumni have gone 
on to work at such agencies as the National Archives and the 
National Park Service.

What You’ll Learn
Through your coursework, you will learn how to

•  Research, interpret, and present historical knowledge
•  Write and speak clearly and appropriately about historical  

information for diverse audiences

•  Engage in history as a moral and ethical practice, recognizing  

a wide range of backgrounds and perspectives

•  Apply historical precedents to contemporary life and develop 

self-reflection

•  Achieve a deep understanding of the different peoples, 

events, and cultures that have shaped human civilization

Accelerated Pathway
If you complete your undergraduate degree at UMGC with a 
major in history, an accelerated pathway between UMGC’s 
undergraduate and graduate programs allows you to reduce 
your total coursework for the Master of Arts in Teaching at 
UMGC by 12 credits (three courses, including the noncredit 
introductory course UCSP 615). Details are on p. 24.

•  Integrate theories, methods, and concepts from multiple 

humanities disciplines, such as philosophy, history, art, litera-
ture, music, and religious studies 

•  Evaluate the adequacy and justifiability of propositions, theo-

ries, assumptions, and arguments

•  Communicate the results of critical reflection into personal 

positions on social, cultural, and ethical issues

Minor in Human Resource Management
The human resource management minor complements the 
skills you gain in your major discipline by examining the human 
resource functions in a private- or public-sector organizational 
setting. These functions include human resource planning; 
recruitment, selection, and placement; employee appraisal and 
compensation; employee training and career development; 
management of labor relations; and development of a human 
resource department implementation plan.

Courses in the Minor (15 Credits)
A minor in human resource management requires the comple-
tion of 15 credits of coursework in human resource manage-
ment. Any HRMN courses apply. It is recommended that you 
take HRMN 300 and 400 for the minor (if you have not already 
applied the courses elsewhere in the degree).

Courses already applied toward other degree requirements  
(e.g., major or general education) may not be applied toward the 
minor. At least 9 credits must be earned in upper-level courses 
(numbered 300 or above). Prerequisites apply for all courses.

For a listing of all the requirements for the bachelor’s degree,  
refer to your major and pp. 32–35.

Laboratory Management

The bachelor’s degree program in laboratory management has 
program-specific admission requirements (listed on p. 9) 
that you must meet before enrolling in any program courses. 

If you have completed virtually all the required lower-level course-
work for the laboratory management major—within an Associate  
of Applied Science degree program at a community college with 
which UMGC has an articulation agreement or within another 
appropriate transfer program—you may seek an academic major 
in laboratory management. Consult an advisor or a success 
coach before electing this major. 
Major in Laboratory Management
UMGC’s program in laboratory management is unique in Maryland: 
no other university in the state offers a bachelor’s degree program 
in laboratory management. Yet the need within the biotechnology 
industry for employees with both scientific and management  
skills is great.

The laboratory management major will help you prepare to coor-
dinate the activities that contribute to a well-ordered labora-
tory by combining an in-depth study of scientific concepts and 
procedures with hands-on laboratory management practice. 

What You’ll Learn
Through your coursework, you will learn how to

•  Create a healthy, safe, and productive workplace by appropri-

ately hiring, training, supporting, and evaluating laboratory 
personnel

•  Plan, organize, and direct the daily work activities of a labora-

tory setting by working independently and as a member of  
a team

•  Communicate in a clear, well-organized manner that effec-
tively persuades, informs, and clarifies ideas, information, 
and laboratory techniques/procedures to staff, the scientific 
community, and the public

•  Practice ethical standards of integrity, honesty, and fairness as 

a laboratory manager

You may seek an academic major in social science.
Major in Social Science
In UMGC’s bachelor’s degree program in social science, you’ll 
gain a breadth of knowledge through interdisciplinary study

Through your coursework, you will learn how to

•  Analyze how quantitative and qualitative methods are used in 

social science research 

•  Communicate social science concepts and research findings 

effectively to a variety of audiences 

•  Examine how micro- and macro-level factors are linked in the 

social lives of individuals, communities, and societies 

•  Analyze complex social issues using theoretical approaches, 

critical-thinking skills, information literacy, technology, or 
interdisciplinary perspectives 

•  Evaluate social science research using ethical principles and 

standards for professional conduct 

•  Apply concepts of diversity, social factors, and global multi-
cultural perspectives to examine practical problems in the 
workplace and society
