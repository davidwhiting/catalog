# Wave university

Wave University is an interactive tutorial app for [H2O Wave](https://wave.h2o.ai/) framework and is aimed at anyone wanting to start developing web apps with nothing but Python.

This app includes a dozen lessons that explain the base concepts necessary for developing apps with H2O Wave. We highly encourage you to go over the tutorial hand in hand with the [official docs](https://wave.h2o.ai/) to get the most information possible.

Each lesson explains a single topic and shows a short demonstration example. The example code is editable and we highly encourage playing around with it and doing your experiments to see how things work. Moreover, most of the lessons also contain a small optional exercise for you to reinforce the newly acquired knowledge.

## Installation

```sh
# Create a virtual env.
python -m venv venv
# Activate virtual env (.\venv\Scripts\activate for Windows)
venv/bin/activate
# Install h2o-wave-university.
pip install h2o-wave-university
# Run it.
wave-university
```

Once both of the above steps are complete, you can go to <http://localhost:10101> in your favorite browser to start learning!
