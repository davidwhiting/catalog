The \\nobjective is to be able to determine when and how model-based \\nsystems engineering (MBSE) approaches are useful, which tools \\nto use, and which data to use as input to the MBSE tools and \\nhow to use the results from the tools in decision-making.\\n', 'prerequisites': 'SYSE 610', 'recommended': '', 'warnings': '', 'substitutions': '', 'done': 1, 'pre': 'SYSE 610'}\n",
