### Suggestions
1. Align naming conventions:
The D3.js code uses period for what seems to be the semester, while your Python code uses both term and period. It would be beneficial to standardize this across both codebases.

2. Simplify color assignment:
The D3.js code doesn't seem to use different colors for different course types. If this is intentional, you could simplify the _set_colors function in the Python code.

3. Adjust data structure:
The D3.js code expects a flat structure for the data, while your Python code creates separate dataframes for courses and headers. Consider merging these into a single structure.

4. Coordinate dimensions:
Ensure that the dimensions (width, height, offsets) in the Python code match those in the D3.js code.

5. Simplify date handling:
The D3.js code generates semester data more simply. You could adopt a similar approach in Python.

### Here are the key improvements and explanations:

1. Unified data structure:

Combined course data and headers into a single list of dictionaries, matching the D3.js expectation.
Removed the separate headers dataframe.

2. Simplified color assignment:

Updated _set_colors to use a dictionary mapping, making it easier to maintain and extend.

3. Aligned naming conventions:

Consistently used period for semesters across the code.

4. Coordinated dimensions:

Used constants for dimensions (e.g., BOX_WIDTH, BOX_HEIGHT) that match the D3.js code.

5. Simplified date handling:

Implemented _generate_semester_data to create semester data more similarly to the D3.js approach.

6. Streamlined data preparation:

Removed unnecessary columns and calculations.
Directly calculated x and y positions based on period and session.

7. Improved create_html_template:

Simplified the function to work with the new data structure.
Removed the need for separate handling of headers.

These changes should make your Python code more closely aligned with the D3.js visualization expectations, potentially reducing discrepancies and improving maintainability. The code is now more concise and focused on producing the exact data structure needed for the D3.js visualization.
