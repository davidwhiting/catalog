tence, their place within their cultures, and their responsibility to 
others and the physical world. 

What You’ll Learn
Through your coursework, you will learn how to

•  Integrate theories, methods, and concepts from multiple 

humanities disciplines, such as philosophy, history, art, litera-
ture, music, and religious studies 

•  Evaluate the adequacy and justifiability of propositions, theo-

ries, assumptions, and arguments

•  Communicate the results of critical reflection into personal 

positions on social, cultural, and ethical issues

Minor in Human Resource Management
The human resource management minor complements the 
skills you gain in your major discipline by examining the human 
resource functions in a private- or public-sector organizational 
setting. These functions include human resource planning; 
recruitment, selection, and placement; employee appraisal and 
compensation; employee training and career development; 
management of labor relations; and development of a human 
resource department implementation plan.

Courses in the Minor (15 Credits)
A minor in human resource management requires the comple-
tion of 15 credits of coursework in human resource manage-
ment. Any HRMN courses apply. It is recommended that you 
take HRMN 300 and 400 for the minor (if you have not already 
applied the courses elsewhere in the degree).

Courses already applied toward other degree requirements  
(e.g., major or general education) may not be applied toward the 
minor. At least 9 credits must be earned in upper-level courses 
(numbered 300 or above). Prerequisites apply for all courses.

For a listing of all the requirements for the bachelor’s degree,  
refer to your major and pp. 32–35.

Laboratory Management

The bachelor’s degree program in laboratory management has 
program-specific admission requirements (listed on p. 9) 
that you must meet before enrolling in any program courses. 

If you have completed virtually all the required lower-level course-
work for the laboratory management major—within an Associate  
of Applied Science degree program at a community college with 
which UMGC has an articulation agreement or within another 
appropriate transfer program—you may seek an academic major 
in laboratory management. Consult an advisor or a success 
coach before electing this major. 
Major in Laboratory Management
UMGC’s program in laboratory management is unique in Maryland: 
no other university in the state offers a bachelor’s degree program 
in laboratory management. Yet the need within the biotechnology 
industry for employees with both scientific and management  
skills is great.

The laboratory management major will help you prepare to coor-
dinate the activities that contribute to a well-ordered labora-
tory by combining an in-depth study of scientific concepts and 
procedures with hands-on laboratory management practice. 

What You’ll Learn
Through your coursework, you will learn how to

•  Create a healthy, safe, and productive workplace by appropri-

ately hiring, training, supporting, and evaluating laboratory 
personnel

•  Plan, organize, and direct the daily work activities of a labora-

tory setting by working independently and as a member of  
a team

•  Communicate in a clear, well-organized manner that effec-
tively persuades, informs, and clarifies ideas, information, 
and laboratory techniques/procedures to staff, the scientific 
community, and the public

•  Practice ethical standards of integrity, honesty, and fairness as 

a laboratory manager

84


 

 

•  Monitor and maintain laboratory-related documentation, 

equipment, and supplies necessary for conducting efficient, 
safe, cost-effective, and hygienic laboratory operations

Remaining required science coursework (6 credits) may be 
applied to elective requirements. Courses may be chosen from 
the following:

•  Manage scientific and laboratory practices and procedures 
by complying with and adhering to national, state, and local 
standards, policies, protocols, and regulations
