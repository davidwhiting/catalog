    Generate a periods structure containing information about terms and sessions.

    A periods structure is a list of dictionary objects or a DataFrame containing information about terms and sessions,

    Parameters:
    - start_term (str): First term classes are to be scheduled into.
    - years (int): Number of years to create periods for (this can be larger than needed).
    - max_courses (int): Maximum number of courses per session.
    - max_credits (int): Maximum number of credits per term.
    - summer (bool): Whether attending summer (as default).
    - sessions (List[int]): Which sessions (1-3) to schedule classes in (excluding summer term, which has only sessions 1 & 2).
    - as_df (bool): Return results as Pandas DataFrame if True, otherwise return as list of dictionary objects.
    - terms (Optional[List[str]]): Custom list of terms to use instead of the default.
    - sessions_per_term (Optional[Dict[str, int]]): Custom dictionary of sessions per term to use instead of the default.

    Returns:

    Generate a periods structure containing information about terms and sessions.

    A periods structure is a list of dictionaries (or a Pandas dataframe) containing information about terms and sessions,

    Parameters:

    - start_term: first term classes are to be scheduled into
    - years: number of years to create periods for (this can be larger than needed)
    - max_courses: maximum number of courses per session
    - max_credits: maximum number of credits per term

    - sessions: which sessions (1-3) to schedule classes in (excluding summer term, which has only sessions 1 & 2)
    - as_df: return results as Pandas dataframe, otherwise return as list of dictionaries

    Output includes 'previous', a value used to determine placement of prerequisites. Because Sessions 1 & 2 and 
    Sessions 2 & 3 overlap, a Session 2 class cannot have a Session 1 prerequisite, it's previous value is 2 (two
    time-slots previous). Similarly, Session 3 cannot have a Session 2 prerequisite, it's previous value is also 2.
    For all others, the 'previous' value is 1.

async def handle_prerequisites(timedConnection, course_df):
    '''
    Expand the course list to include necessary prerequisites.

    Group_satisfied approach:

    1. For each group of prerequisites associated with a course, we iterate over each individual 
       prerequisite in the group.
    2. For each prerequisite, we check if it's already present in courses_dict. If it is, then the 
       group is considered satisfied, and we move on to the next group.
    3. If the prerequisite is not present in courses_dict, we perform wildcard (*) and optional (+) 
       matching to check if any existing courses match the pattern. If such a course is found, the 
       group is considered satisfied.
    4. If no existing courses satisfy any prerequisite in the group, we proceed to update and add the 
       missing prerequisites to courses_dict and rows_to_append.

       This approach ensures that we only update and add missing prerequisites if none of the prerequisites 
       in a group are already satisfied by existing courses in courses_dict. If any prerequisite in the 
       group is already satisfied, we skip updating and adding new prerequisites for that group.

    Features:

    1. Recursive Function: The recursive_add_prerequisites function takes a prerequisite name, checks 
       if it's already in courses_dict, and if not, it retrieves its information using update_prerequisites.
    2. Recursion: If the prerequisite has its own prerequisites, recursive_add_prerequisites is called 
       recursively for each of them.
    3. Updating courses_dict and rows_to_append: The function ensures that all necessary prerequisites are 
       added to courses_dict and rows_to_append.
    4. Processing Main Courses: The main loop processes each course with prerequisites, using the recursive 
       function to ensure all prerequisites are included.

    Expand the course list to include necessary prerequisites.

    Group_satisfied approach:

    1. For each group of prerequisites associated with a course, we iterate over each individual 
       prerequisite in the group.
    2. For each prerequisite, we check if it's already present in courses_dict. If it is, then the 
       group is considered satisfied, and we move on to the next group.
    3. If the prerequisite is not present in courses_dict, we perform wildcard (*) and optional (+) 
       matching to check if any existing courses match the pattern. If such a course is found, the 
       group is considered satisfied.
    4. If no existing courses satisfy any prerequisite in the group, we proceed to update and add the 
       missing prerequisites to courses_dict and rows_to_append.

       This approach ensures that we only update and add missing prerequisites if none of the prerequisites 
       in a group are already satisfied by existing courses in courses_dict. If any prerequisite in the 
       group is already satisfied, we skip updating and adding new prerequisites for that group.

    Features:

    1. Recursive Function: The recursive_add_prerequisites function takes a prerequisite name, checks 
       if it's already in courses_dict, and if not, it retrieves its information using update_prerequisites.
    2. Recursion: If the prerequisite has its own prerequisites, recursive_add_prerequisites is called 
       recursively for each of them.
    3. Updating courses_dict and rows_to_append: The function ensures that all necessary prerequisites are 
       added to courses_dict and rows_to_append.
    4. Processing Main Courses: The main loop processes each course with prerequisites, using the recursive 
       function to ensure all prerequisites are included.
